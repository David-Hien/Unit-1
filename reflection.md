## Question 1: What are the steps in the design cycle?
1. PLanning
2. Design

## Question 2: What is the purpose of the success criteria?
To give the developer a simple outline of how the project should look like, and give the client an idea of what they can expect.

## Question 3: What do you understand now about computers/Computer Science? That you did not learn before Unit 1?
I recognize the importance of planning before starting the project. I struggle a lot when programming without a detailed plan and wasted time.

## Question 4: What do you understand now about yourself that you did not before Unit 1?
I didn't pay much attention on how I structure my codes for other developers to work with and understand. It occurred to me that in order to become a software engineer, I must have good coding practices so that I could work more efficiently with other people and the client.

## Question 5: What worked well for you during the development of Unit 1?
Although I spend more time than I initially planned to take to develope the game, I didn't encounter as many roadblocks and the whole process was enjoyable.

## Question 6: What didn't work for you during the development of Unit 1?
Because my plan wasn't clear, I struggle with time management and had to do a lot more work close to the deadline.

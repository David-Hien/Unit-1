Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer

In my opinion, it is beneficial for both the show owner and the developer to communicate during the production because the end product will be more likely to satisfy the costumer. As they are involved in the process, the clients can review and give feedback on the test product. Thus, the developer can adjust accordingly to create a final product that better meets the needs.
  

Question 2: Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

For my game, it is necessary for me to create MVPs. I want to have most of the basic functions and the first level completed to be ready for the first beta testing. The client will then give feed back on the gameplay experience, whether it's the coding issues such as lag and bugs, or game story and style. After which I can adjust my approach accordingly.


Question 3: Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.

The Human Centered Design cycle presented in the video includes the steps:  obeservation, idea generation, prototyping, and testing
The Design Cycle we use for developing software includes the following:     planning, design, developement, evaluation, and implementation
Both the cycle involve some planning, designing, and testing processes.


Question 4: What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.

Observation:      We look into how humans interact with the world and with other people.
Idea generation:  Come up with ideas regarding our observations.
Prototyping:      Proposing and designing the solution.
Testing:          Evaluate the practicality of the solution in real life situations.


Question 5. Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Playersâ€™ Experience using Human-centered design. Write below your ideas:

First, I'll follow the success criteria to design my game. I will create a demo for the game with basic functions for the client to test whether they like the genre and concept or not. Afterwards, I will finish a beta version where more people can test for system bugs and survey for user experience.
